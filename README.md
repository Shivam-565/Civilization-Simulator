🌍 Civilization Simulator

Welcome to **Civilization Simulator**, a Python-based simulation that models the growth, behavior, and interactions of civilizations over time. This project explores emergent dynamics such as population growth, migration, and cultural development using agent-based modeling.

🎯 Features

- ⚙️ Customizable simulation parameters for population, resources, and technology
- 📈 Dynamic visualization of civilization spread and evolution
- 🧠 Basic AI logic to simulate decision-making and inter-civilization interaction
- 🗺️ Map-based environment with terrain and resource allocation
- ⏱️ Time-step iteration with statistical logging
